# Hi, I'm Yasmine Elnadi :wave:

I am a software developer with a background in electronics and communications engineering. I obtained my master's degree in creating a fault-tolerant model in WSN NCS greenhouse architecture, which was able to tolerate the failure of multiple access points while balancing system cost and downtime cost. My work on this project was recognized as I published three papers on IEEE. Before moving to the United States in 2019, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant for three years.

I am passionate about software development because it combines my love for technology with my ability to create and solve complex problems. I find it incredibly fulfilling to see the results of my work come to life and make a positive impact on people's lives.
